<!-- Test for NULL Values 

For testing for NULL values, comparison operators are not available.
That's why we need to use IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators instead.

Syntax

SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NULL;

SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;
